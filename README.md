# ğŸ¤– Machine Learning Project - Learning Purpose

This repository contains a machine learning/data science project I undertook for educational purposes. The aim was to improve my understanding of end-to-end ML workflows, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

> ğŸ“Œ **Note:** This project was created strictly for learning and self-improvement purposes.
